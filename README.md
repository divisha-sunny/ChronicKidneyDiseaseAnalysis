**Description:**

This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying individuals at high risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various demographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors associated with CKD, such as blood pressure abnormalities, haemoglobin levels, age, BMI, and lifestyle habits. By conducting exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and utilizing machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, the goal is to create a model capable of accurately predicting CKD risk for new patients. Evaluation of model performance is conducted using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

**Key Features:**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and identify data quality issues.
Feature Engineering to extract relevant features predictive of CKD.
Implementation of various machine learning algorithms for model training and testing.
Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.
Selection of the final model based on performance to predict CKD risk for new patients.

**Data Source:**

The dataset contains information collected from 2000 individuals, including 15 observations for each individual, and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavanbodanki/blood-press).
